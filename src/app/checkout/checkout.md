## Checkout Component Overview

This component allows buyer users with an open order to submit their order with shipping, billing, and payment information.

It uses the Orders, and LineItems resources to build up the data.

Checkout is a buyer perspective component, and can only be accessed when logged in as a buyer user, or when impersonating a buyer user.
