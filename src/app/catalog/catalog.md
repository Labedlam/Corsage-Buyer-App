## Catalog Component Overview

This component allows buyer users to view categories, sub-categories, and products assigned to them.

It uses the Me resource to list the correct data for the logged in user.

If you have configured Category and Product Facets using the Facets component, the catalog component will take care of displaying those facets to the buyer user while browsing the catalog.

Catalog is a buyer perspective component, and can only be accessed when logged in as a buyer user, or when impersonating a buyer user.
